# Challenge 4: Set Operations

## Concept  
Performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

## Objective  
Combine and compare sets using set operations.

## Task  
- Create two sets: `set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}` and `set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}`
- Print the union, intersection, and difference

## Code Example
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

set3 = set.union(set2, set1)

print("All the numbers", set3)

set4 = set.intersection(set2, set1)

print("Common numbers", set4)
