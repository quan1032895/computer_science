Create a list named 'colors' with the items: ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple'].
Slice the list to get the second and third colors (from index 1 to 3, excluding 3).
Store the sliced result in a variable named 'sliced_colors'.
Print 'sliced_colors'.
Find and print the length of the 'colors' list using the length function.
